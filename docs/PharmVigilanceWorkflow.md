# Pharmacovigilance Clinical Workflow

## Overview
This document outlines the standardized clinical workflow for pharmacovigilance reporting within the healthcare system. It provides a structured approach to identifying, documenting, and reporting adverse drug reactions (ADRs), with a focus on antiretroviral therapy (ART) monitoring.

## Workflow Triggers

### Routine Triggers
- Six months have passed since the last pharmacovigilance assessment
- Patient reports new symptoms during routine visit
- Healthcare provider observes potential ADR signs 
- Change in medication regimen

### Alert-Based Triggers
- Abnormal lab results (elevated liver enzymes, abnormal renal function)
- Decreasing CD4 count despite adherence
- Viral load above 1000 copies/ml (unsuppressed)
- Drug-drug interaction alerts

## Clinical Process Flow

### 1. Registration & Initial Assessment
**Purpose**: Capture basic reporting information and patient identification
**Key Components**:
- Date of reporting documentation
- Healthcare facility identification
- District and province recording
- Initial reason for pharmacovigilance assessment selection

### 2. Patient Details Collection
**Purpose**: Document comprehensive patient information
**Key Components**:
- First and last name verification
- Date of birth and sex documentation
- Contact details confirmation (phone number)
- Physical address documentation (house number, road, area, city/town/village)
- ART number and token verification

### 3. HIV History Documentation
**Purpose**: Establish baseline HIV treatment context
**Key Components**:
- HIV diagnosis date recording
- Initial ART start date documentation
- Current ART regimen identification
- Treatment history review

### 4. Vital Signs Assessment
**Purpose**: Document current clinical status
**Key Components**:
- Weight and height measurement
- BMI calculation (automatic from height/weight)
- Blood pressure recording
- Temperature documentation

### 5. Medical Tests Review
**Purpose**: Assess laboratory indicators of treatment efficacy and potential toxicity
**Key Components**:
- CD4 count tracking (with dates)
- Viral load monitoring (with dates)
- Liver function tests (ALT, AST)
- Renal function assessment (creatinine)
- Other relevant laboratory tests

### 6. Co-Morbidities Screening
**Purpose**: Identify additional health conditions that may impact treatment
**Key Components**:
- Tuberculosis screening
- Diabetes mellitus assessment
- Hypertension screening
- Mental illness evaluation
- Renal disease screening
- Liver disease screening
- Stroke history documentation
- Cardiovascular disease assessment
- Seizures screening
- Allergies documentation (including asthma)

### 7. Risk Factors Evaluation
**Purpose**: Document behaviors that may impact treatment outcomes
**Key Components**:
- Smoking status and intensity
- Alcohol consumption and frequency
- Other substance use documentation
- Medication adherence assessment

### 8. Adverse Drug Reactions Assessment
**Purpose**: Document and classify potential medication side effects
**Key Components**:
- Initial ADR screening question
- Structured symptom assessment by body system
- Symptom grading (1-4 severity scale)
- Additional symptom specification
- Key fields:
  - Drug name
  - Reaction type
  - Severity
  - Onset date
  - Description
  - Action taken
  - Outcome

### 9. ART History Review
**Purpose**: Document antiretroviral medication history
**Key Components**:
- Current regimen documentation
- Previous regimens recording
- Start and end dates for each regimen
- Reason for regimen changes
- Duration on each regimen
- Adherence history assessment
- Specific ART regimens:
  - TDF+XTC+DTG
  - TAF+FTC+DTG
  - AZT+3TC+DRV-r
  - AZT+3TC+DTG
  - ABC+3TC+DTG
  - Other regimens as applicable

### 10. Pregnancy Assessment (Women 15-49)
**Purpose**: Document pregnancy status and contraception for women of childbearing age
**Key Components**:
- Pregnancy status confirmation
- Last menstrual period documentation
- Contraception method recording
- Pregnancy test results if applicable
- Special focus on "Pregnant or Breastfeeding Women (PBW)" category

### 11. Outcomes Documentation
**Purpose**: Record clinical decisions and next steps
**Key Components**:
- Pharmacovigilance outcomes selection
- Viral load status determination (suppressed/unsuppressed)
- Follow-up plan documentation
- Referral requirements if needed

## Decision Points and Workflow Paths

### Suspected ADR Identified
1. Document reaction details in Adverse Reactions section
2. Grade severity (1-4)
3. Determine causality:
   - Certain
   - Probable/Likely
   - Possible
   - Unlikely
   - Conditional/Unclassified
   - Unassessable/Unclassifiable
4. Determine intervention required:
   - No change in regimen
   - Dose adjustment
   - Temporary interruption
   - Drug discontinuation
   - Additional treatment for ADR

### Viral Load Outcome Assessment
1. If VL < 1000 copies/ml: Record as "Suppressed"
2. If VL â‰¥ 1000 copies/ml: Record as "Unsuppressed"
3. For unsuppressed patients:
   - Assess adherence
   - Consider resistance testing
   - Evaluate for regimen change

### Pregnancy-Related Path
1. If female patient aged 15-49:
   - Activate pregnancy assessment section
   - Document LMP and pregnancy status
   - Assess regimen for pregnancy safety
2. If pregnant:
   - Ensure regimen is pregnancy-safe
   - Schedule more frequent monitoring
   - Document in maternal health record

## Form Submission and Follow-up

### Submission Process
1. Review all sections for completeness
2. Submit completed form to electronic records
3. Generate pharmacovigilance report number
4. Link to patient's electronic health record

### Follow-up Actions
1. Schedule next assessment based on findings:
   - Routine follow-up in 6 months if no significant findings
   - Earlier follow-up if ADR identified or clinical concern
2. Generate referrals if needed:
   - Specialist consultation
   - Additional testing
   - Adherence counseling
3. Monitor for resolution of identified issues

## Quality Assurance Checkpoints

### Data Quality Verification
- Required fields completion check
- Date consistency validation
- Logical checks between related values
- BMI automatic calculation from height/weight

### Clinical Decision Support
- Drug interaction alerts
- Abnormal lab value highlighting
- Age-specific field activation/deactivation
- Pregnancy-related warnings for certain medications

## Related Processes

### Integration with SmartCare
- Data synchronization with central system
- Historical record retrieval
- National reporting compliance

### Regulatory Reporting
- Severe ADR reporting to national health authority
- Aggregate data submission for pharmacovigilance monitoring
- Compliance with national reporting requirements

### Documentation Requirements
- Utilizes standardized form structure based on Zambian Ministry of Health guidelines
- PDF generation for record keeping and transfer to SmartCare system
- Clinical summary review for continuity of care
