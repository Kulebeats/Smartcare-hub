ased on the Zambian ANC Guidelines, here are the updated descriptions of the danger signs:

Bleeding & Delivery
Vaginal bleeding
Any amount of vaginal bleeding during pregnancy may indicate placental abruption, placenta previa, cervical issues, or threatened abortion. According to the guidelines, bleeding can occur anytime from conception to birth, and all bleeding must be treated as serious and be immediately attended to. Bleeding in the 2nd and 3rd trimester is a possible sign of problems. Assess amount, color, and associated pain. Always requires immediate evaluation.

Draining
Amniotic fluid leak or rupture of membranes (PROM/PPROM) may be a gush or a slow, steady trickle of clear, straw-colored, or greenish fluid from the vagina. It indicates the protective barrier around the fetus is broken, increasing the risk of infection (chorioamnionitis) and preterm labor. If the baby's head is not engaged, there is a risk of umbilical cord prolapse, which is a medical emergency.

Imminent delivery
This refers to signs that birth is about to happen immediately. Key indicators include an overwhelming urge to bear down or push, strong and frequent contractions (less than 2 minutes apart), the mother grunting with contractions, or the baby's head being visible at the vaginal opening (crowning). This requires immediate preparation for a safe birth, regardless of location.

Labour
This is defined as regular, painful uterine contractions that cause progressive changes to the cervix (effacement and dilation). When this occurs before 37 completed weeks of gestation, it is 

preterm labor, a significant danger sign that can lead to premature birth. The guidelines define preterm labor as labor that occurs after 20 weeks but before 37 weeks of pregnancy. Infants born before 37 weeks are at an increased risk for health problems. Assessment involves evaluating the frequency, duration, and strength of contractions.

Neurological
Convulsing
Also known as an eclamptic seizure, this is a life-threatening emergency. It involves tonic-clonic (shaking and stiffening) movements and loss of consciousness. It is a sign of eclampsia, a severe complication of high blood pressure in pregnancy. The priority is to manage the patient's airway, prevent injury, and administer magnesium sulfate to control the seizure.

Severe headache
A new-onset, persistent, and often throbbing headache that is not relieved by usual painkillers like paracetamol. It is a hallmark symptom of 

pre-eclampsia, a condition which the guidelines identify as a serious medical condition. Severe headaches are listed as a key symptom.

Visual disturbance
New vision problems such as seeing flashing lights or spots (scotomata), double vision, or temporary loss of vision. Like a severe headache, this is a key sign of severe pre-eclampsia or impending eclampsia. The guidelines list "blurred vision" as a symptom of pre-eclampsia.

Unconscious
A state of unresponsiveness where the patient cannot be roused. This is a critical emergency with many potential causes in pregnancy, including eclampsia, severe blood loss (hypovolemic shock), septic shock, or diabetic coma. Immediate assessment of airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC) is vital.

Systemic
Fever
A body temperature ≥38°C (100.4°F) with chills or rigors. It often signals a serious infection, such as chorioamnionitis (infection of the amniotic sac), pyelonephritis (kidney infection), or sepsis. Fever significantly increases the metabolic demands on both the mother and fetus and requires urgent investigation to find and treat the source.

Looks very ill
This is a crucial clinical sign based on professional judgment. The patient may appear lethargic, confused, pale, or have cool, clammy skin. It often signifies the onset of sepsis or shock before vital signs dramatically change. Trusting this "gut feeling" can lead to earlier life-saving interventions.

Severe vomiting
Persistent vomiting that prevents the patient from keeping down any food or fluids. The guidelines recognize "Nausea and Vomiting" as a physiological complication of pregnancy. While many women experience this in the first trimester, some may experience it beyond 20 weeks, and pharmacological treatments may be required for distressing symptoms. Severe cases can lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and nutritional deficiencies (ketosis), which can harm both mother and fetus.





Severe abdominal pain
Intense, non-contraction pain in the abdomen. The guidelines recognize "Lower Back and Pelvic Pain" as a common physiological symptom in pregnancy. The location of severe pain can provide clues: upper right abdomen pain may suggest HELLP syndrome (a severe form of pre-eclampsia); sharp, constant pain could indicate placental abruption; generalized tenderness with fever may suggest infection.
