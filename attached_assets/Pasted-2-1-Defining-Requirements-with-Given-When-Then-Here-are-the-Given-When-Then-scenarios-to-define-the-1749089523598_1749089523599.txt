2.1. Defining Requirements with Given-When-Then
Here are the Given-When-Then scenarios to define the "Displaying Patient Record Search Results" feature, now including the specific behavior for the "Attend to Patient" button:

Scenario: Successful Search Displaying a Single Patient Record with Specific Action Button Behavior

Given a user is on the "Search or Add New Patient" page.
And the user has entered a valid and specific search criterion (e.g., a unique "ART Number," "NUPN," or "Cellphone") into the search input field.
And the user has selected the corresponding search type (e.g., "ART Number" radio button).
When the user clicks the "Search" button.
And the system finds exactly one patient record matching the entered criteria.
Then the patient's record summary should be displayed clearly on the page.
And this summary should include: Patient's Full Name, Date of Birth (with calculated age), Sex, Cellphone number, NUPN, ART Number, and Mother's Name.
And a series of action buttons specific to that patient ("Edit Profile," "Admission," "Appointment," "Assign Queue," "Historical visit," "Vitals," "Attend to Patient") should be displayed directly associated with their record.
And when the user clicks the "Attend to Patient" button, they should be navigated to the "service selection page" for that patient.
Scenario: Successful Search Displaying Multiple Patient Records with Specific Action Button Behavior

Given a user is on the "Search or Add New Patient" page.
And the user has entered a general search criterion (e.g., a common "Full Name") that is likely to match multiple patients.
When the user clicks the "Search" button.
And the system finds multiple patient records matching the criteria.
Then a list or tabular view of all matching patient record summaries should be displayed.
And each record summary in the list should display key distinguishing information (e.g., Full Name, Date of Birth, ART Number, NUPN).
And each patient record in the list must have its own set of associated action buttons, including an "Attend to Patient" button.
And when the user clicks the "Attend to Patient" button for a specific patient in the list, they should be navigated to the "service selection page" for that selected patient.
And the system may display a count of the number of records found.
Scenario: Search Yielding No Matching Patient Records

Given a user is on the "Search or Add New Patient" page.
And the user has entered search criteria.
When the user clicks the "Search" button.
And the system finds no patient records matching the entered criteria.
Then a clear, user-friendly message should be displayed (e.g., "No patient records found matching your criteria. You can try different search terms or Add New Patient.").
And the area designated for patient records should not display any previous results.
Scenario: Attempting Search with Invalid or Empty Criteria

Given a user is on the "Search or Add New Patient" page.
And the user has not entered any text into the search input field OR has entered data in an obviously invalid format for the selected search type.
When the user clicks the "Search" button.
Then a validation message should appear, prompting the user to enter valid search criteria.
And no search query should be sent to the backend.
And the patient record display area should remain unchanged.
Scenario: Clarity and Accessibility of Displayed Patient Data and Actions

Given one or more patient record summaries are displayed after a search.
When the user views these records.
Then all displayed data fields (Full Name, Date of Birth, Sex, Cellphone, NUPN, ART Number, Mother's Name) should be clearly labeled or their meaning should be evident.
And the calculated age next to the Date of Birth should be accurate.
And all action buttons should have clear, concise labels indicating their function, with "Attend to Patient" clearly implying progression to service selection.
And the layout should be responsive.
2.2. Enhancing Prompts for New Features
1. Please assess the enhancement and determine what steps need to be taken to address the change.

This feature defines how users retrieve patient records and initiate actions. The clarification that "Attend to Patient" leads to a "service selection page" is a key part of this. Steps include:

UI Design Confirmation: Confirm the overall search and results display UI.
API Integration: Ensure backend search APIs function correctly.
Frontend Logic for Search & Display: Implement search execution and rendering of single/multiple results, no-results messages, and error handling.
Action Button Integration:
Crucially, ensure the "Attend to Patient" button is specifically programmed to navigate the user to the "service selection page," passing the context of the selected patient.
Other action buttons ("Edit Profile," etc.) should link to their respective functionalities.
State Management: Manage search criteria, results, loading, and error states.
Navigation: Implement routing for the "service selection page" and ensure the "Attend to Patient" button triggers this navigation with the correct patient ID.
Testing: Thoroughly test all search scenarios, result displays, and particularly the "Attend to Patient" button's navigation to the service selection page.
2. Describe your understanding of the requirements.

My understanding is that the "Search or Add New Patient" page in "SmartCare PRO" should allow users to search for patients using various criteria. The search results will display a summary of patient information. A key interactive element is the set of action buttons for each patient record, where specifically:

The "Attend to Patient" button, when clicked, must navigate the user directly to a "service selection page" for the chosen patient.
Other functionalities include displaying single or multiple matches, or a "no records found" message.
The displayed patient data should be clear, and input validation should occur for the search terms.
3. Are there any key considerations you need to keep in mind when proceeding with this plan as to not disrupt any existing functionality?

Existing Search API & Service Selection Page:
The search API's functionality needs to be stable.
The "service selection page" must exist or be concurrently developed. The "Attend to Patient" button will need its defined route/URL.
Patient Context Preservation: When navigating from the search result (via "Attend to Patient") to the "service selection page," the selected patient's ID or context must be correctly passed to the target page so it can load relevant services for that specific patient.
Performance for Multiple Results & Actions: If many results are displayed, ensure action buttons remain responsive.
Data Security and Privacy (PHI): Standard considerations for PHI apply.
"Add New Patient" Workflow: This should remain unimpeded.
Consistency: The UI and interaction patterns should be consistent.
4. Propose best practice user experience for completing this.

Clear Call to Action: The "Attend to Patient" button should be clearly labeled. Given its function, perhaps "Attend & Select Services" or similar could be even more explicit if space allows, but "Attend to Patient" is fine if it's understood within the application's context to lead to service selection.
Seamless Navigation: The transition to the "service selection page" should be quick and smooth, with the patient context clearly carried over (e.g., the service selection page might display the patient's name).
Loading Indicators: Use for search and potentially for the navigation to the service selection page if it involves data loading.
Informative Messages: For search results and errors.
Accessible Design: For all elements.
Responsive Layout: Essential for usability on various devices.
5. Assess any other best practices that may be relevant & keep in mind how the application is currently implemented.

Modular Routing: Ensure navigation paths (like to the service selection page) are well-defined and managed.
Auditing: Log when a user proceeds to "Attend to Patient" and selects services.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Access to the "Attend to Patient" button and the subsequent "service selection page" might be role-dependent.
Client-Side Validation: For search inputs.
6. Generate a step-by-step plan to implement this enhancement.

Phase 1: API Definition & Backend Preparation
Confirm patient search API (as detailed previously).
Ensure backend support for identifying the patient for the "service selection page."
Phase 2: Frontend - Search Interface & Input Handling (as detailed previously)
Phase 3: Frontend - API Call & State Management (as detailed previously)
Phase 4: Frontend - Displaying Single Patient Result & Action Button Logic
Develop the component for a single patient record.
For the "Attend to Patient" button in this component, implement an onClick handler that:
Retrieves the patient's ID.
Navigates the user to the "service selection page" route, passing the patient ID (e.g., /patient/{patientId}/select-services).
Implement other action buttons.
Phase 5: Frontend - Displaying Multiple Patient Results & Action Button Logic
Develop the component for listing multiple patient summaries.
Ensure each patient in the list has an "Attend to Patient" button with the same navigation logic as above, specific to that patient.
Phase 6: Frontend - Service Selection Page (Stub or Full Integration)
Define the route for the "service selection page" (e.g., /patient/:patientId/select-services).
If the page doesn't exist, create a placeholder or ensure the team developing it provides the route and expected parameters.
Phase 7: Frontend - Handling No Results and Messages (as detailed previously)
Phase 8: Testing
Test all search scenarios.
Critically test:
Clicking "Attend to Patient" for a single result navigates to the correct service selection page with the patient's context.
Clicking "Attend to Patient" for a patient in a multiple-results list navigates correctly.
UX Testing.
Phase 9: Deployment (as detailed previously)
7. Do not make changes that will break other features within the application; keep the scope of your enhancements limited to just the feature request.

Understood. The focus is on the search result display and the defined behavior of its action buttons, particularly "Attend to Patient" navigating to the service selection page. The service selection page itself is a separate feature, but its entry point from this feature is now clearly defined.

8. Then, identify how the technical changes will be made and propose it in a skeleton framework.

(Assuming a common web application stack, e.g., React/Angular/Vue frontend with a REST API backend. This is a conceptual skeleton, with updates for the "Attend to Patient" button.)

Frontend (e.g., React)

PatientSearchPage Component: (Largely the same as previous description)

State: searchType, searchTerm, searchResults, isLoading, errorMessage, noResultsMessage.
Renders search inputs, buttons, and conditional display of results or messages.
performSearch() method calls patientApiService.searchPatients().
SinglePatientRecordDisplay Component:

Props: patient (object).
Render:
Displays patient details.
<PatientActionButtons patient={patient} />
MultiplePatientResultsDisplay Component:

Props: results (array of patient objects).
Render:
A list or table.
For each patient in results:
<PatientSummaryRow patient={patient} />
<PatientActionButtons patient={patient} />
PatientActionButtons Component:

Props: patient (object containing at least patient.id).
(Using a hypothetical useNavigate hook from a router like React Router)
JavaScript

import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom'; // Example for React Router

function PatientActionButtons({ patient }) {
  const navigate = useNavigate();

  const handleAttendToPatient = () => {
    navigate(`/patient/${patient.id}/select-services`); // Navigate to service selection page
  };

  const handleEditProfile = () => {
    navigate(`/patient/${patient.id}/edit-profile`); // Example
  };

  // ... other button handlers

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={handleEditProfile}>Edit Profile</button>
      {/* ... other buttons like Admission, Appointment ... */}
      <button onClick={handleAttendToPatient}>Attend to Patient</button>
    </div>
  );
}
export default PatientActionButtons;
patientApiService (Service/Module): (Same as previous description)

searchPatients(searchType, searchTerm): Fetches patient data.
Routing Configuration (e.g., in React Router)

JavaScript

<Routes>
  <Route path="/search-patient" element={<PatientSearchPage />} />
  <Route path="/patient/:patientId/select-services" element={<ServiceSelectionPage />} />
  <Route path="/patient/:patientId/edit-profile" element={<EditProfilePage />} />
  {/* ... other application routes ... */}
</Routes>
Backend (Conceptual REST API Endpoint for Search) (Same as previous description)

GET /api/patients
Do not proceed until I have confirmed your approach & understanding is sound.

Please review this updated breakdown for the "Displaying Patient Record Search Results" feature, which now fully incorporates the requirement that the "Attend to Patient" button navigates to the "service selection page." Confirm if this accurately reflects your requirements.
