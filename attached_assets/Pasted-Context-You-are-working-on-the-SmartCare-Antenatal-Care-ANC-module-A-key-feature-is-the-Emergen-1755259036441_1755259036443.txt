Context: You are working on the SmartCare Antenatal Care (ANC) module. A key feature is the "Emergency Referral" workflow, which includes a detailed checklist. The current checklist is static. The goal is to make it dynamic and context-aware based on the specific clinical danger sign that triggers the referral.

Objective:
Create a React component or a JSON data structure that groups and prioritizes items from a master EmergencyChecklist based on the triggering DangerSign. This will allow the UI to intelligently display the most critical actions first for a given emergency.

Input Data:

Danger Signs (Grouped by Category):

Bleeding & Delivery: 'Vaginal bleeding', 'Draining', 'Imminent delivery', 'Labour'

Neurological: 'Convulsing', 'Unconscious', 'Severe headache', 'Visual disturbance'

Systemic/Sepsis: 'Fever', 'Looks very ill', 'Severe vomiting'

Master Emergency Checklist Items (by Section):

Communication: 'Receiving facility contacted', 'Reason for referral communicated', etc.

Pre-Referral Procedures: 'IV access secured', 'Urinary catheter inserted', 'Blood samples collected', 'Bedside clotting test done', 'Urinalysis done'

IV Fluids & Medications: 'IV fluids administered', 'Appropriate drugs given'

Vital Signs Monitoring: 'BP', 'Pulse', 'Temp', 'RR'

Special Procedures: 'Anti-shock garment/UBT applied', 'Estimated blood loss', 'Patient positioned appropriately'

Final Steps: 'Details discussed with patient/family', 'Referral form completed', 'Referral register updated'

Core Logic / Business Rules:

You must map the danger signs to a prioritized list of checklist items. Use the following clinical reasoning:

For Bleeding & Delivery Complications:

Clinical Focus: Volume Replacement & Shock Management.

Critical Priorities: Items related to Special Procedures (blood loss), IV Fluids & Medications, and Vital Signs Monitoring.

Secondary Actions: Items related to Pre-Referral Procedures (IV access, blood samples) and patient positioning.

For Neurological Emergencies (Convulsing, Unconscious):

Clinical Focus: Seizure Control & Airway Protection (ABCs).

Critical Priorities: Items related to Special Procedures (patient positioning), IV Fluids & Medications (especially Magnesium Sulfate), and Vital Signs Monitoring (BP).

Secondary Actions: Pre-Referral Procedures (IV access, catheter, urinalysis).

For Suspected Severe Pre-eclampsia (Severe headache, Visual disturbance):

Clinical Focus: Assessment and prevention of eclampsia.

Critical Priorities: Vital Signs Monitoring (BP) and Pre-Referral Procedures (Urinalysis for protein).

Secondary Actions: IV Fluids & Medications (securing IV access in preparation for meds).

For Systemic Illness / Suspected Sepsis (Fever, Looks very ill):

Clinical Focus: Infection Control & Fluid Resuscitation.

Critical Priorities: IV Fluids & Medications (antibiotics, fluids) and Vital Signs Monitoring.

Secondary Actions: Pre-Referral Procedures (blood samples for cultures).

Baseline Items: The Communication & Coordination and Final Steps sections are considered standard procedures required for all referrals.

Output Requirements:

Generate a JSON object or a TypeScript data structure where the keys are the danger sign categories and the value is an object containing prioritized arrays of checklist items (critical, secondary, standard).
