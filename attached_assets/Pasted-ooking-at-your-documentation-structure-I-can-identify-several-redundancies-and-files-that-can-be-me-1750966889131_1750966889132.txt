ooking at your documentation structure, I can identify several redundancies and files that can be merged or removed. Let me analyze the docs and related files:

Redundancies Found:
1. Duplicate Documentation Files:
BestPractices.md (root) and docs/BestPractices.md
DataStructure.md (root) and docs/DATA_STRUCTURE_COMPREHENSIVE.md
Features.md (root) and docs/Features.md
Overview.md (root) and docs/Overview.md
Performance.md (root) and docs/Performance.md
Technical.md (root) and docs/Technical.md
Usage.md (root) and docs/Usage.md
UserStories.md (root) and docs/UserStories.md
2. Overlapping Implementation Summaries:
docs/ART_NUMBER_SEARCH_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
docs/CSV_UPLOAD_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
docs/PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md
docs/SECURITY_VALIDATION_SUMMARY.md
docs/SMARTCARE_PRO_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
docs/SYSTEM_STATUS_JUNE_8_2025.md
docs/MODULE_EXTRACTION_SUMMARY.md
These can be consolidated into docs/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARIES.md

3. Architecture Documentation Overlap:
docs/BACKEND_ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md
docs/BACKEND_ARCHITECTURE_COMPREHENSIVE.md
docs/CDSS_Architecture_Overview.md
These should be merged into a single comprehensive architecture document.

4. Backup/Corrupted Files:
server/routes.ts.backup
server/routes.ts.corrupted
server/routes_clean.ts
server/routes-fixed.ts
server/storage-clean.ts
5. Old/Unused Scripts:
create-admin.ts (root) - duplicate of scripts/create-new-admin.ts
create-test-users.ts (root) - duplicate functionality in scripts folder
Multiple test files in root that should be in __tests__ folder
6. Export/Module Files:
art_pharmacovigilance_export.tsx
prep_module_export.tsx
art_pharmacovigilance_modules.zip
Proposed Actions:
Remove duplicate root-level docs (keep docs/ versions)
Consolidate implementation summaries into single file
Merge architecture docs into comprehensive guide
Remove backup/corrupted files
Clean up root-level scripts (move to scripts/ or remove)
Remove old export files
Consolidate test files in proper directory
Files to Remove (23 files):

Root: BestPractices.md, DataStructure.md, Features.md, Overview.md, Performance.md, Technical.md, Usage.md, UserStories.md
Root scripts: create-admin.ts, create-test-users.ts
Backup files: server/routes.ts.backup, server/routes.ts.corrupted, server/routes_clean.ts, server/routes-fixed.ts, server/storage-clean.ts
Individual implementation summaries: 6 files
Export files: 3 files
Files to Merge:

Architecture docs into single comprehensive document
Implementation summaries into consolidated guide
Should I proceed with removing these redundant files and consolidating the documentation structure?
