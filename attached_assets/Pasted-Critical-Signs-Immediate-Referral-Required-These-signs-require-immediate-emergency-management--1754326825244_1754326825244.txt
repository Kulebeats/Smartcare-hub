Critical Signs (Immediate Referral Required)
⚠️ These signs require immediate emergency management and referral. Do not delay treatment.

Convulsing
Seizures, fits, or uncontrolled muscle contractions - may indicate eclampsia (BP >140/90 + proteinuria + seizures), severe pre-eclampsia, or epilepsy. IMMEDIATE ACTIONS: Position on left side, protect airway, give MgSO4 4g IV loading dose + 1g/hr maintenance. Life-threatening emergency.
Unconscious
Not responding to voice, touch, or painful stimuli (GCS <8) - may indicate post-ictal state (eclampsia), severe hypoglycemia (<2.2mmol/L), or cerebral complications. IMMEDIATE: Secure airway, check blood glucose, vital signs, and neurological assessment.
Severe headache
Persistent, throbbing headache not relieved by rest or paracetamol, often frontal or occipital - classic sign of severe pre-eclampsia (BP >160/110). Check: BP, urine protein, deep tendon reflexes (DTRs), and epigastric pain. May progress to eclampsia.
Visual disturbance
Blurred vision, seeing spots/scotomata, flashing lights, or temporary vision loss - indicates severe pre-eclampsia with possible cerebral edema or retinal changes. URGENT: Check BP, fundoscopy for papilledema/hemorrhages. High risk for eclampsia within hours.
Vaginal bleeding
Any amount of vaginal bleeding during pregnancy - may indicate placental abruption, placenta previa, cervical issues, or threatened abortion. Assess amount, color, and associated pain. Always requires immediate evaluation.
Imminent delivery
Active labor with cervical dilation >7cm, baby crowning, or uncontrollable urge to push. Prepare for immediate delivery or urgent transfer. Check fetal presentation and cord visibility.
Severe abdominal pain
Constant severe cramping, knife-like, or tearing abdominal pain - may indicate placental abruption, uterine rupture, appendicitis, or ectopic pregnancy. Assess uterine tenderness and fetal heart rate.
Other Important Signs
ℹ️ These signs require careful evaluation and may need urgent referral depending on severity.

Draining
Amniotic fluid leak or rupture of membranes (PROM/PPROM) - clear, blood-stained, or greenish fluid leaking from vagina. May indicate preterm labor, infection risk, or cord prolapse. Check gestational age and fetal movement.
Labour
Regular uterine contractions before 37 weeks gestation (preterm labor) - contractions every 5-10 minutes lasting 30+ seconds. May lead to premature birth. Assess cervical changes and fetal wellbeing.
Fever
Body temperature ≥39°C (102.2°F) or ≥38°C with chills/rigors - may indicate chorioamnionitis, UTI, malaria, or sepsis. Higher risk if membranes ruptured. Check for source and culture specimens.
Looks very ill
Appears distressed, lethargic, pale, sweating, or critically unwell - non-specific but important danger sign. May indicate sepsis, severe anemia, or multi-organ dysfunction. Assess vital signs and oxygen saturation.
Severe vomiting
Persistent vomiting unable to keep fluids/food down >24 hours, signs of dehydration - may indicate hyperemesis gravidarum, pre-eclampsia, or gastroenteritis. Check for ketones and electrolyte imbalance.
Pre-eclampsia/Eclampsia Management Protocol
Immediate Assessment (Within 5 minutes):
• Blood pressure (repeat if >140/90)
• Urine dipstick for proteinuria (≥2+ significant)
• Deep tendon reflexes (hyperreflexia = brisk/clonus)
• Assess for epigastric pain (liver capsule stretching)
• Check for facial/hand edema
Severe Pre-eclampsia Criteria (Any 1):
• BP ≥160/110 mmHg on 2 occasions 4hrs apart
• Proteinuria ≥3+ or ≥5g/24hrs
• Severe headache or visual disturbances
• Epigastric/RUQ pain
• Oliguria <500ml/24hrs
MgSO4 Protocol (If seizures/severe PE):
• Loading: 4g IV over 20 minutes
• Maintenance: 1g/hour IV infusion
• Monitor: Respiratory rate >12, reflexes present, urine > 30ml/hr
• Antidote: Calcium gluconate 10ml of 10% IV
General Clinical Management
Immediate Actions:
• Take vital signs (BP, pulse, temperature, respiratory rate)
• Assess level of consciousness (AVPU or GCS)
• Check fetal heart rate and movement
• Establish IV access if signs of shock/dehydration
• Position patient on left side if unconscious
Documentation Requirements:
• Time of onset and duration of symptoms
• Associated symptoms and triggers
• Vital signs and clinical findings
• Interventions given and patient response
• Gestational age and fetal status
Emergency Referral Protocol:
• Call ahead to receiving facility (obstetric unit)
• Stabilize airway and breathing before transport
• Continue MgSO4 during transport if started
• Accompany with detailed referral note
• Monitor maternal and fetal status en route
