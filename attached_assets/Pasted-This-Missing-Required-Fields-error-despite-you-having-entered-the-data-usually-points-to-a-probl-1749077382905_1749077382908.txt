This "Missing Required Fields" error, despite you having entered the data, usually points to a problem in how the data is being captured, sent, or validated. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what might be happening and how to troubleshoot, relating it to the POST /api/patients backend code we discussed:

Possible Causes & How to Investigate:

Frontend Not Sending the Data Correctly:

Issue: The input fields on your form might look filled, but the actual data might not be correctly included in the payload sent to the backend. This could be due to issues with form state management, how the data object is constructed before sending, or incorrect field names.
Troubleshooting:
Check the Network Request: This is the most crucial step.
Open your browser's Developer Tools (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect").
Go to the "Network" tab.
Try submitting the registration form again.
Find the request to /api/patients (it will likely be a POST request).
Click on it and inspect the Payload (or "Request Body") section.
Verify:
Are firstName, dateOfBirth, and cellphoneNumber (or whatever key your frontend uses for cellphone, e.g., cellphone) present in the JSON payload?
Do they have the values you entered?
Are there any typos in the field names (e.g., fistName instead of firstName)? The backend is case-sensitive.
Frontend Validation Logic (If any before sending):

Issue: Your frontend might have its own validation logic that runs before submitting to the backend. This local validation could be incorrectly flagging fields as empty.
Troubleshooting:
Review the JavaScript code that handles form submission on the client side. Is there any validation logic there that could be causing this modal to appear?
Backend Validation (patientSchema):

Issue: The validate(patientSchema) middleware on your backend (POST /api/patients) is designed to check if the incoming data matches the patientSchema. If the fields listed in the modal (First Name, Date of Birth, Cellphone Number) are marked as required in your patientSchema and the backend doesn't receive them correctly (as verified in step 1), it will reject the request with a 400 error. The frontend then likely displays this modal based on the error response.
Troubleshooting (related to step 1):
If the network payload looks correct, double-check your patientSchema definition. Ensure the field names and types (e.g., string, date) match exactly what the frontend is sending and what the backend expects for these required fields.
Pay attention to how cellphoneNumber (or cellphone) is defined as required in the schema.
Backend Manual Validation Block (Less likely for this specific modal content but possible):

Issue: Your backend POST /api/patients route has a manual block:
JavaScript

if (
  !firstName ||
  !surname ||
  !dateOfBirth ||
  !sex ||
  !mothersName ||
  !mothersSurname
) { /* ... returns 400 with a "Missing required fields" message ... */ }
This block checks for a different set of fields than what your modal is showing. The modal specifically mentions Cellphone Number, which is not in this manual backend check. This suggests the error is more likely coming from the patientSchema validation or a frontend issue. However, if other fields like firstName or dateOfBirth were also somehow failing this specific backend check, it could contribute.
Data Transformation Issues (Frontend or Backend):

Issue: Data might be unintentionally altered or lost:
Before being sent by the frontend (e.g., a function that prepares the data might be buggy).
Less likely here, but sometimes middleware on the backend could alter req.body before it reaches your route handler, though your current middleware setup (xssClean, validate) shouldn't cause this specific problem.
Key things to focus on from the screenshot:

The modal lists "First Name", "Date of Birth", and "Cellphone Number" as missing.
The "Go to this section" button suggests the frontend has some awareness of which fields are problematic.
Immediate Next Steps for You:

Inspect the Network Request Payload: As detailed above, this will tell you exactly what data is (or isn't) reaching your backend. This is often the quickest way to find the culprit.
Examine the Network Response: When the error occurs, what is the HTTP status code from /api/patients (e.g., 400)? What is the JSON response body? The response body often contains details from the backend about which validation failed, which your frontend uses to display such modals.
Review patientSchema: Ensure that firstName, dateOfBirth, and cellphoneNumber (or the equivalent key for cellphone) are defined as required and their types match what you expect.
