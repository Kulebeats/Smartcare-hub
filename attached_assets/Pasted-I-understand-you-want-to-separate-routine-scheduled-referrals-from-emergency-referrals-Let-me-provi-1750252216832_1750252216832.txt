I understand you want to separate routine/scheduled referrals from emergency referrals. Let me provide a detailed plan for restructuring the referral system:

Detailed Plan for Referral Section Restructure
1. New Section Structure
Current Location: Emergency Referral (mixed routine + emergency)
New Structure:
Section 1: "Referral" (routine/scheduled) - next to Counselling
Section 2: "Emergency Referral" (urgent/immediate)
2. Routine Referral Section (ANC.C6)
Content to include:

ANC.C.DE2: Reason for referral (Select all that apply)
ANC.C.DE3: Referral for screening including diagnostics and lab testing
ANC.C.DE4: Referral for other general services
Scheduled referral: Hospital delivery indicated
Reasons for Routine Referral:

Pre-existing medical conditions (from current emergency section)
Diagnostic tests and lab screening
Scheduled hospital delivery
Other general services
Specialist consultation needs
3. Emergency Referral Section (Urgent)
Content to keep:

Immediate danger signs
Life-threatening conditions
Urgent obstetric emergencies
Severe complications requiring immediate care
4. Content Migration Plan
FROM Emergency Referral TO Routine Referral:

Pre-existing medical conditions section
Diagnostic/screening referrals
Scheduled delivery planning
General specialist consultations
Medical history & risk factors
KEEP in Emergency Referral:

Severe preeclampsia/eclampsia
Heavy bleeding
Severe danger signs
Immediate life-threatening conditions
Emergency transport requirements
5. Implementation Structure
Routine Referral Section:

├── ANC.C6 Reason for referral (checkboxes)
├── Pre-existing medical conditions (moved from emergency)
├── Diagnostic/screening needs
├── Scheduled delivery planning
├── Client health history (moved from emergency)
├── Treatment before referral
└── Referral facility information
Emergency Referral Section (streamlined):

├── Immediate danger signs
├── Emergency conditions
├── Urgent transport needs
├── Emergency treatment given
└── Emergency receiving facility
6. Business Logic Changes
Routine referrals: Standard assessment, planned care
Emergency referrals: Immediate action, urgent transport
Risk stratification: Determines which referral type is appropriate
Clinical decision support: Guides referral urgency
Would you like me to proceed with this restructure? The plan involves:

Creating new "Referral" section next to Counselling
Moving appropriate content from Emergency Referral
Streamlining Emergency Referral for urgent cases only
Maintaining all existing functionality with better organization
