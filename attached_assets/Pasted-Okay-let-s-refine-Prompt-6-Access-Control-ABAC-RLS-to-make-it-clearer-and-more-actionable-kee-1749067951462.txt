Okay, let's refine Prompt 6 (Access Control: ABAC + RLS) to make it clearer and more actionable, keeping in mind it's for a prototype on Replit.

Here's an improved version:

ðŸ”’ Step 6: Implement Granular Access Control (ABAC + RLS)
Objective: Secure patient data by implementing Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) at the application layer and Row-Level Security (RLS) at the database layer. This will ensure users can only access data they are authorized for, particularly restricting access to data within their own facility.

Part 1: Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
Define Access Policies:

Under a new /policies directory in your Replit project, create a file named abac.json.
Populate it with JSON rules. These rules define who can do what. The conditions often link user attributes to resource attributes.
JSON

[
  {
    "subject": "Clinician",
    "resource_type": "patient",
    "action": "read",
    "description": "Clinicians can read patient data within their own facility.",
    "conditions": {
      "match_facility_id": true
    }
  },
  {
    "subject": "Clinician",
    "resource_type": "patient",
    "action": "create",
    "description": "Clinicians can create patients within their own facility.",
    "conditions": {
      "match_facility_id_on_body": true
    }
  },
  {
    "subject": "FacilityAdministrator",
    "resource_type": "patient",
    "action": "read",
    "description": "Facility Administrators can read any patient data within their own facility.",
    "conditions": {
      "match_facility_id": true
    }
  },
  {
    "subject": "SystemAdministrator",
    "resource_type": "*",
    "action": "*",
    "description": "System Administrators have unrestricted access."
  }
]
Self-review: match_facility_id_on_body implies the middleware would check req.body.facility_id against req.user.facility_id for create actions.
Implement ABAC Middleware:

Create middleware/abac.ts. This middleware will be responsible for enforcing the policies defined in abac.json.
Key logic for abacMiddleware(resourceType) function:
Load and parse abac.json (ideally once when the app starts).
Extract role and facility_id from req.user (populated by your auth middleware).
Determine the action based on req.method (e.g., GET -> "read", POST -> "create", PUT -> "update", DELETE -> "delete").
Iterate through policies in abac.json:
Find a policy where subject matches req.user.role, resource_type matches the resourceType parameter passed to the middleware, and action matches the determined action.
If a "SystemAdministrator" rule for * resource and * action is matched, allow access.
If conditions.match_facility_id is true:
For "read" actions on a specific patient (e.g., /api/patients/:id), you'll need to fetch the patient's record first to get their facility_id, then compare it with req.user.facility_id. If they don't match, deny with 403. (This can be inefficient. A common pattern is to let RLS handle this filtering, and ABAC focuses on role-action-resource type permissions, or ABAC works in tandem with RLS by checking params/body if possible before DB query).
Alternative for efficiency for read (if facility_id is in URL or query for lists): Check req.params.facility_id or req.query.facility_id if your routes are structured that way.
If conditions.match_facility_id_on_body is true (e.g., for "create"):
Check if req.body.facility_id matches req.user.facility_id. If not, deny with 403.
If no matching policy explicitly allows the action, or a condition check fails, respond with res.status(403).json({ message: 'Forbidden' });.
Otherwise, call next();.
Example (Conceptual - GET /api/patients/:id):

TypeScript

// In middleware/abac.ts (simplified)
// const policies = require('../policies/abac.json'); // Load policies

export const checkAccess = (resourceType: string) =>
  async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    const userRole = req.user?.role;
    const userFacilityId = req.user?.facility_id;
    const action = getActionFromMethod(req.method); // Implement getActionFromMethod

    const matchedPolicy = policies.find(p =>
      p.subject === userRole &&
      (p.resource_type === resourceType || p.resource_type === '*') &&
      (p.action === action || p.action === '*')
    );

    if (!matchedPolicy) return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Forbidden: No matching policy' });

    if (matchedPolicy.subject === 'SystemAdministrator' && matchedPolicy.resource_type === '*' && matchedPolicy.action === '*') {
      return next();
    }

    // Handle conditions
    if (matchedPolicy.conditions?.match_facility_id_on_body) {
      if (req.body.facility_id !== userFacilityId) {
        return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Forbidden: Cannot create resource outside your facility.' });
      }
    }

    if (matchedPolicy.conditions?.match_facility_id && action === 'read' && req.params.id) {
      // For reading a specific patient, RLS is often a better primary enforcer.
      // If ABAC must do it, it needs to know the resource's facility_id.
      // This might involve a pre-fetch or trusting RLS to filter and ABAC just checks role-action.
      // For simplicity here, we'll assume RLS handles the actual data filtering for reads,
      // and ABAC ensures the role *can* perform the "read" action on "patient" type.
      // A stricter ABAC would fetch the patient here, check facility_id, then 403 if mismatched.
      // The prompt's test for 403 on cross-facility read implies ABAC needs to do this check.
      // This means you'd need a DB call here if not filtering by facility_id in the main controller query already.
      // To avoid DB call in ABAC, controller should fetch: SELECT * FROM patient_core WHERE id = ? AND facility_id = ?
      // ABAC then just ensures role allows 'read' on 'patient'.
      // For the test "user from facility A cannot fetch patient from B (should return 403)", ABAC must deny.
      // This implies ABAC needs to know the target patient's facility. The most straightforward (but less performant if patient not already fetched)
      // is for the controller to pass the fetched patient object (or just its facility_id) to an ABAC check function
      // *after* fetching, or for ABAC to make its own fetch (less ideal).
      // Let's assume for the prompt, the route is for listing patients OF a specific facility:
      // e.g. GET /api/facilities/:facility_id/patients. ABAC could check req.params.facility_id.
      // Or, for GET /api/patients/:id, the controller fetches the patient and THEN ABAC checks.
      // Given the prompt, let's make ABAC responsible for the 403 if facility IDs don't match for specific patient reads.
      // This implies fetching the target resource's facility_id if not available in request.
    }
    // Fallback: If policy matches but conditions are not met implicitly by this point (or not defined clearly for a specific path)
    // it's safer to deny if unsure. This logic needs careful implementation based on actual route patterns.

    return next();
  };
Self-review: The match_facility_id for read on a specific patient (/api/patients/:id) is the trickiest. RLS will filter silently (404 or empty). To get a 403 as requested by the test, ABAC must know the target patient's facility ID. This means either: the controller fetches the patient, then calls a more refined ABAC check; or ABAC itself fetches the patient (less ideal); or RLS is relied upon and the test accepts a 404. Given the prompt's expectation of 403, ABAC must be able to determine the mismatch.

Part 2: Row-Level Security (RLS) in PostgreSQL
Update Authentication Middleware (e.g., middleware/auth.ts):

After successfully verifying the JWT or session and populating req.user (including req.user.facility_id), set the app.facility_id runtime parameter for the current PostgreSQL session. This parameter will be used by RLS policies.
Important: Ensure req.user.facility_id is an integer.
TypeScript

// Inside your existing authentication middleware, after user is verified:
if (req.user && req.user.facility_id) {
  try {
    // For Prisma:
    await prisma.$executeRawUnsafe(`SET app.facility_id = '${String(req.user.facility_id)}'`);
    // For node-postgres (pg library):
    // await dbClient.query(`SET app.facility_id = $1`, [req.user.facility_id]);
    console.log(`RLS context set: app.facility_id = ${req.user.facility_id}`);
  } catch (dbError) {
    console.error('Failed to set RLS context:', dbError);
    // Decide if this should be a critical failure
  }
}
next();
Enable RLS and Create Policies in PostgreSQL:

Connect to your PostgreSQL database (e.g., via Replit's "Shell" using psql, or your DB provider's interface).
Run the following SQL commands. Ensure the database user your Replit app connects with does not have the BYPASSRLS attribute by default.
SQL

-- Make sure the setting can be recognized
ALTER SYSTEM SET session_preload_libraries = 'app_settings'; -- May require DB restart or superuser
-- Or rely on direct setting if preload is complex in Replit managed DB.

-- For patient_core table
ALTER TABLE patient_core ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE patient_core FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; -- Ensures for table owner too

CREATE POLICY patient_facility_isolation ON patient_core
  FOR ALL -- Apply to SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
  USING (facility_id = current_setting('app.facility_id', true)::int)
  WITH CHECK (facility_id = current_setting('app.facility_id', true)::int);
  -- 'USING' applies to rows returned by SELECT/UPDATE/DELETE targets
  -- 'WITH CHECK' applies to rows being INSERTED or UPDATED

-- For anc_records table
ALTER TABLE anc_records ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE anc_records FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY anc_facility_isolation ON anc_records
  FOR ALL
  USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM patient_core pc
      WHERE pc.id = patient_id AND pc.facility_id = current_setting('app.facility_id', true)::int
    )
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM patient_core pc
      WHERE pc.id = patient_id AND pc.facility_id = current_setting('app.facility_id', true)::int
    )
  );

-- Repeat for other patient-scoped tables (e.g., prescriptions, art_follow_ups, clinical_alerts)
-- Example for prescriptions:
-- ALTER TABLE prescriptions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- ALTER TABLE prescriptions FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- CREATE POLICY prescription_facility_isolation ON prescriptions
--   FOR ALL
--   USING ( EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM patient_core pc WHERE pc.id = patient_id AND pc.facility_id = current_setting('app.facility_id', true)::int) )
--   WITH CHECK ( EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM patient_core pc WHERE pc.id = patient_id AND pc.facility_id = current_setting('app.facility_id', true)::int) );
Note: current_setting('app.facility_id', true) makes it non-fatal if the setting is missing, returning NULL. Self-review: Adding FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY is good practice. FOR ALL and WITH CHECK are also more robust.
Part 3: Configuration (Replit Secrets)
Add Environment Variable for RLS Toggle:

In your Replit, go to the "Secrets" tab.
Add a new secret: RLS_ENABLED and set its value to true.
Your application (e.g., the authentication middleware or ABAC) can read this using process.env.RLS_ENABLED.
Conditional Logic (Optional but recommended for testing):

In your authentication middleware, you might conditionally run the SET app.facility_id command based on RLS_ENABLED:
TypeScript

if (process.env.RLS_ENABLED === 'true' && req.user && req.user.facility_id) {
  // ... set app.facility_id
}
Similarly, your ABAC middleware could have conditional logic if its facility checks should be bypassed when RLS_ENABLED is false for testing purposes.
Part 4: Jest Tests (__tests__/accessControl.test.ts)
Goal: Ensure ABAC denies unauthorized actions with 403, and RLS (when active) prevents data leakage from other facilities (typically resulting in 404s or empty arrays if ABAC doesn't catch it first for a 403). The prompt wants a 403 for cross-facility fetches.

Setup Test Data:

User A (e.g., role "Clinician", facility_id: 1).
User B (e.g., role "Clinician", facility_id: 2).
Patient P1 (belongs to facility_id: 1).
Patient P2 (belongs to facility_id: 2).
Test Scenarios:

ABAC - Role/Action (Example - No facility check needed for this specific test):

A user with a role "Analyst" (not defined for patient resource in abac.json) attempts to read Patient P1.
Expected: HTTP 403 Forbidden from ABAC middleware.
ABAC + RLS - Cross-Facility Read Attempt (Enforcing the 403):

User A (Clinician, Facility 1) attempts to fetch Patient P2 (from Facility 2) via /api/patients/${P2.id}.
To achieve a 403 (as per original prompt): Your ABAC middleware for read on patient resource must somehow know Patient P2.facility_id. This means:
The controller for /api/patients/:id fetches the patient without RLS facility filtering (e.g. using a privileged DB role for this specific query, or temporarily disabling RLS for that query â€“ complex).
Then, it passes the fetched patient's facility_id to the ABAC middleware/function for a decision.
ABAC compares req.user.facility_id with fetchedPatient.facility_id and returns 403 if mismatched. This is a bit convoluted. A more common pattern is ABAC checks role/action, and RLS handles instance-level data filtering silently (leading to 404 if not found in user's facility). If a 403 is strictly required for cross-facility reads of specific items, ABAC needs that item's facility_id.
If ABAC can't get P2.facility_id pre-query for /api/patients/:id:
User A attempts to fetch Patient P2.
ABAC allows based on role "Clinician" can "read" "patient".
The database query (with RLS active via SET app.facility_id = 1) for Patient P2 will return nothing (as if P2 doesn't exist for User A).
Expected: HTTP 404 Not Found.
Choose one expectation (403 or 404 for cross-facility read) and implement ABAC/controller logic accordingly. The prompt originally asked for 403.
ABAC + RLS - Allowed Read Attempt:

User A (Clinician, Facility 1) attempts to fetch Patient P1 (from Facility 1).
Expected: HTTP 200 OK with Patient P1 data.
ABAC - Cross-Facility Create Attempt:

User A (Clinician, Facility 1) attempts to POST new patient data with facility_id: 2.
Expected: HTTP 403 Forbidden from ABAC middleware (due to match_facility_id_on_body condition).
RLS Disabled Scenario (Test the toggle):

Temporarily set process.env.RLS_ENABLED = 'false' for this test block.
User A (Clinician, Facility 1) attempts to fetch Patient P2 (from Facility 2).
Expected: HTTP 200 OK with Patient P2 data (assuming ABAC's facility checks are also bypassed or less strict when RLS_ENABLED is false). This tests that your RLS_ENABLED toggle correctly bypasses the isolation.
