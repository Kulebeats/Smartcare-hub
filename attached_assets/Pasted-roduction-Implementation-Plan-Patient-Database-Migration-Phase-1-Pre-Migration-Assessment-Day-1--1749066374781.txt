roduction Implementation Plan: Patient Database Migration
Phase 1: Pre-Migration Assessment (Day 1-2)
Current State Analysis:

Current patient table: Empty (0 records)
Database schema: Legacy flat structure
Risk level: LOW (no existing patient data to migrate)
Validation Steps:

Database backup verification
Schema compatibility check
Application downtime window planning
Rollback procedure testing
Phase 2: Schema Implementation (Day 3)
New Database Structure:

patient_core: Main patient data with normalized fields
patient_contacts: Phone/email with versioning
patient_address: Address history tracking
patient_family: Family relationships
audit_events: Complete audit trail
data_subject_requests: GDPR compliance
Implementation Order:

Create ENUMs and base tables
Add indexes for performance
Create audit tables
Set up triggers and functions
Create compatibility view
Phase 3: Application Updates (Day 4-5)
Backend Changes Required:

Update patient schema in shared/schema.ts
Modify storage layer for new table structure
Update API endpoints for normalized data
Add audit logging middleware
Implement GDPR request handlers
Frontend Changes Required:

Update patient registration forms
Modify patient search functionality
Update ANC module patient data handling
Add audit trail viewing capability
Phase 4: Testing & Validation (Day 6)
Testing Strategy:

Unit tests for new schema operations
Integration tests for patient workflows
Performance testing with sample data
Audit trail verification
GDPR compliance testing
Impact Assessment
Positive Impacts:

âœ… Improved data normalization and integrity
âœ… Complete audit trail for compliance
âœ… GDPR compliance built-in
âœ… Better performance with proper indexing
âœ… Address and contact history tracking
âœ… Family relationship management
Risk Mitigation:

ðŸ”’ Zero data loss risk (no existing patients)
ðŸ”’ Backward compatibility view maintained
ðŸ”’ Comprehensive rollback plan
ðŸ”’ Staged deployment approach
Estimated Downtime:

Migration execution: 15-30 minutes
Application restart: 5 minutes
Total impact: Under 1 hour
Migration Execution Steps
Pre-deployment:

-- Backup current database
pg_dump smartcare_db > backup_pre_migration.sql
Schema deployment:

-- Execute migration script
\i migratePatients.sql
Application deployment:

Deploy updated backend code
Deploy updated frontend code
Restart application services
Post-deployment validation:

Verify all tables created successfully
Test patient registration workflow
Validate audit logging
Check performance metrics
Rollback Plan
If issues arise:

Stop application
Restore database from backup
Deploy previous application
