2. Business Rules
A. Data Entry Rules
Field	Type	Allowed Values	Validation Logic
Gravida (Total Pregnancies)	Integer	≥ 1	Must be a positive integer (minimum 1 if pregnant)
No. of Previous Pregnancies	Integer	≥ 0	Must be a non-negative integer; cannot exceed Gravida - 1
B. Logical Constraints
Relationship Rule:
No. of Previous Pregnancies = Gravida - 1

Example: If Gravida = 3 (currently pregnant for the third time), then No. of Previous Pregnancies = 2
Mandatory Fields:
Gravida is mandatory for all antenatal clients
No. of Previous Pregnancies is mandatory if Gravida > 1
Auto-Calculation:
When the current pregnancy is registered, the system should auto-calculate:
No. of Previous Pregnancies = Gravida - 1
Allow manual override only if clinical scenario justifies (with reason required)

Error Messaging:
If No. of Previous Pregnancies > (Gravida - 1), display error:
“Number of previous pregnancies cannot exceed Gravida minus one.”
Edit Restrictions:
Once recorded for a pregnancy episode, historical values should be immutable except by users with elevated privileges and audit logging
2. Core Business Rules
A. Data Entry and Validation
Field	Type	Allowed Values	Validation Logic
Gravida	Integer	≥ 1	Must be at least 1 if currently pregnant
Para	Integer	≥ 0	Cannot exceed Gravida
Abortions/Miscarriages	Integer	≥ 0	Cannot exceed Gravida
Living children	Integer	≥ 0	Cannot exceed Para

B. Logical Constraints and Relationships
1.	Primary Relationships:
o	Gravida = Para + Abortions/Miscarriages + Current Pregnancy (if applicable)
	For antenatal visits (current pregnancy):
Gravida = (Para + Abortions/Miscarriages) + 1
o	Living children ≤ Para
2.	Range Validation:
o	If Gravida < (Para + Abortions/Miscarriages):
	Display error: "Sum of live births and abortions/miscarriages cannot exceed total pregnancies."
o	If Living children > Para:
	Display error: "Number of living children cannot exceed number of live births."
o	If Para > Gravida:
	Display error: "Live births cannot exceed total pregnancies."
3.	Mandatory Field Rule:
o	All four fields must be completed for every new antenatal registration.
4.	Data Consistency:
o	When Gravida is updated, prompt for review/update of the other related fields.
o	All updates to historical pregnancy data must be auditable, with a reason required for manual overrides.

D. Error Messaging
•	If field relationships are violated, display precise, user-friendly error messages (see above).
•	On manual override, require reason entry and trigger an audit log entry.

E. Data Quality and Integrity
•	Outlier detection:
Flag any values outside typical clinical norms (e.g., Gravida > 15, Living children > Para) for secondary review.
•	Duplicate prevention:
Ensure that each pregnancy is only counted once in the EHR.

3. Example Clinical Scenario
•	A client presents for her 5th pregnancy.
o	Gravida: 5 (includes current)
o	Para: 3 (three pregnancies reached viability and resulted in live birth)
o	Abortions/Miscarriages: 1
o	Living children: 3
System logic checks:
•	Para + Abortions/Miscarriages = 4 → Add 1 (current) = 5 (matches Gravida)
•	Living children (3) ≤ Para (3): OK
