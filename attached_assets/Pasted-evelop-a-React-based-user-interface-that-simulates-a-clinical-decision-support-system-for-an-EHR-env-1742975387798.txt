evelop a React-based user interface that simulates a clinical decision support system for an EHR environment. This system will include a toast notification mechanism and a dedicated Pharmacovigilance section with interactive modals.

Requirements:

Toast Notification System:

Placement & Timing:
Toast notifications must appear in the top-right corner of the screen.
Each toast should be visible for 4 seconds before automatically disappearing.
Visual Design:
Toasts should have a blue background with borders.
Inside the blue background, include a lighter box to visually separate the content.
Behavior:
Ensure that the toast notifications do not obstruct the user experience and are dismissible after the allotted time.
Pharmacovigilance Section:

Card Renaming:
Change the label of the "Pharmacovigilance Report" card to simply "Pharmacovigilance."
Modal Interaction:
When a user clicks on the Pharmacovigilance card, display a modal popup that explains the available entry options.
Entry Options to Include in the Modal:
Routine:
Display a message indicating that this option provides a link to initiate a pharmacovigilance check if six months have passed since the last active check.
Adverse Reaction Onset:
Indicate that an observed adverse reaction is being recorded.
Change of ART Regime:
If there is a change in the ART regimen, trigger active monitoring for at least three post-change visits.
ART Naive:
For newly initiated patients, require monitoring with a minimum of three visits.
Follow Up Visit:
Specify that this option should be used for follow-up visits after an initial adverse drug reaction onset.
Design Considerations for the Modal:
Clearly present each entry option with a brief explanation of the action or monitoring requirement.
Ensure the modal is easy to read and navigate, with a clear call-to-action for closing the modal or proceeding with a selected option.
Additional Notes:

The interface should be intuitive and optimized for clinical workflow, ensuring that alerts and modals are informative yet unobtrusive.
Focus on a clean, professional design that aligns with healthcare UI/UX best practices.
