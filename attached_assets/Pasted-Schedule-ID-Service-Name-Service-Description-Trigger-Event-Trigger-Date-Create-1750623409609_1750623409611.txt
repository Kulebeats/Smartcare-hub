EXAMPLE ANC SCHEDULE		
				
 	Interval Rules & Deviations
 	Rule 1	< 20 wks, contacts should be scheduled at 8 wks
 	Rule 2	≥ 20 wks, contacts should be scheduled at 6 wks
 	Rule 3	≥ 26 wks, contacts should be scheduled at 4 wks
 	Rule 4	≥ 34 wks, contacts should be scheduled at 2 wks
 	Rule 5	if the logic skips the 40 wks contact, she must come for delivery at 41 weeks
 	Rule 6	the woman MUST come in at 41 wks if she hasn't given birth already (however this does not count as an official contact)
 	Rule 7	if the woman comes in for the first time at 22 wks or later, we have changed the logic to increase the number of contacts, especially those in the 3rd trimester, as follows: 
- for women who come in at 22 and 23 wks (they have one contact added) by increasing Contacts to every 2 wks after 30 wks (rather than 34 wks)
- for women who come in at 28 and 29 wks (they have one contact added) by increasing contacts to every 2 wks after 32 wks (rather than 34 wks)
- for women who come in after 30 wks all her visits are every 2 wks
