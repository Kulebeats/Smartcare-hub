Begins when a person with a confirmed HIV diagnosis presents to a facility where HIV care is provided and a medical record, patient card, file or chart is opened for the first time. This could be at an HIV care/ART, MNCH or TB clinic.
WHO recommends that all patients be enrolled in HIV care at their first facility visit following an HIV-positive diagnosis (which may take place in the same facility or on the same day as the HIV diagnosis).
For patients who may have received prior ART, “newly enrolled” includes treatment-experienced patients with or without clinical records who received ART from sources outside the system (e.g. patient seen by private practitioner, patient buys drugs themselves or is sent drugs), or PrEP or short-course ARV prophylaxis for PMTCT, and have not been counted as “newly enrolled” in a system that is being monitored nationally. If a facility receives a treatment-experienced patient without records who was previously treated at a facility that reports to the national programme (and, therefore, reported as “newly enrolled” once before), an attempt should be made to retrieve the records and confirm that the patient was previously on treatment.
