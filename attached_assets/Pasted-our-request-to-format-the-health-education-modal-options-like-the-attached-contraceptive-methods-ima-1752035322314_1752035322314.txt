our request to format the health education modal options like the attached contraceptive methods image, I understand you want:

Remove Priority Elements: Eliminate any priority indicators/labels from the health education modal
Two-Column Grid Layout: Arrange options in a 2-column grid (2 options per row) similar to the contraceptive methods layout
"All" Option Behavior: Each section should have an "All" option that automatically checks all other options in that section
Visual Layout Match: Options should be displayed side-by-side in pairs, resembling the contraceptive methods card layout
Key Considerations
Preserve Existing Functionality: Maintain all current checkbox logic, state management, and data saving
Consistent UI/UX: Keep the established design patterns while updating the grid layout
Responsive Design: Ensure the 2-column layout works well on different screen sizes
Accessibility: Maintain proper labeling and keyboard navigation
Best Practice Implementation
The optimal approach is to:

Update the grid layout from md:grid-cols-3 to md:grid-cols-2 for consistent 2-per-row display
Remove any priority-related styling or indicators
Ensure the "All" option remains visually distinct while fitting the new layout
Maintain proper spacing and visual hierarchy
Step-by-Step Plan
Update Grid Layout: Change the TopicCheckboxGrid component to use 2 columns consistently
Remove Priority Elements: Strip out any priority-related styling, badges, or indicators
Maintain "All" Functionality: Keep the existing "All" checkbox behavior intact
Test Responsive Behavior: Ensure the layout works on mobile and desktop
Technical Implementation
The changes will focus on the TopicCheckboxGrid component within the health education modal, specifically updating the CSS grid classes and removing priority-related elements.

client/src/components/medical-record/health-education-modal.tsx
The implementation is now complete! The health education modal will display options in a clean 2-column grid layout, matching the contraceptive methods card style you referenced. Each section maintains its "All" option functionality while providing a more organized visual presentation.
