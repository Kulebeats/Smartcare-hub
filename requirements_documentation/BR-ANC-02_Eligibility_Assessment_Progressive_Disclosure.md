## User Story

### 1. Title
Progressive Disclosure PrEP Eligibility Assessment with Clinical Safety Screening

### 2. User Story
**As a** healthcare provider evaluating PrEP candidacy during antenatal consultations,  
**I want** a structured eligibility assessment with intelligent progressive disclosure and comprehensive clinical safety screening,  
**So that** I can systematically determine PrEP appropriateness while ensuring patient safety, informed consent, and efficient clinical workflow within 8 minutes per evaluation.

### 3. Acceptance Criteria
| # | Given | When | Then |
|---|-------|------|------|
| 1 | The provider opens the eligibility tab with visibleSections state initialized | They navigate from risk assessment with activeTab = "eligibility" | Section A (risk_reduction_counselling_provided) and Section F (Clinical Safety) display with visibleSections.sectionA = true and visibleSections.sectionF = true, while visibleSections.sectionC/D/E = false by default |
| 2 | The provider selects "yes" for client_interested_in_prep triggering updateSectionVisibility() | They answer client interest with assessmentData.client_interested_in_prep = "yes" | System executes updateSectionVisibility("yes"), sets visibleSections.sectionD = true and visibleSections.sectionE = true, showing Acute HIV Symptoms and Medical History sections with proper validation |
| 3 | The provider selects "no" for client_interested_in_prep | Client indicates no interest with assessmentData.client_interested_in_prep = "no" | updateSectionVisibility("no") executes, visibleSections.sectionC = true (Follow-up Planning), while sectionD and sectionE remain false, requiring planned_next_steps array completion |
| 4 | The provider completes mandatory fields triggering validateEligibilityCompletion() | All 5+ mandatory fields pass validation with getEligibilityCompletion().isComplete = true | PrepEligibilityModal opens automatically with eligibilityData containing completion status, clinical recommendations generated through generateClinicalRecommendations(), and action buttons available |
| 5 | The provider clicks "Initiate PrEP & Continue to Prescription" in PrepEligibilityModal | handleEligibilityAction("INITIATE_PREP_AND_PRESCRIBE") is triggered | Modal closes through onClose(), handleTabChangeWithRestrictions("prescription") executes, page scrolls to prescription section using scrollIntoView(), toast notification confirms action completion |
| 6 | Provider completes Section A with risk_reduction_counselling_provided = "no" | They select counseling not provided | validateCounselingSection() requires counselling_not_provided_reasons array completion, validates "other" text field if selected, and blocks clinical safety section until proper justification provided |
| 7 | Provider attempts to access Section F before meeting prerequisites | They click clinical safety tab with isClinicalSafetyAvailable() = false | showClinicalSafetyToast() displays with specific missing requirements, Section F remains locked with visual indicators, and clinicalSafetyToastShown state prevents duplicate notifications |
| 8 | Provider completes conditional screening with hepatitis_b_screening = "yes" | They indicate hepatitis B screening performed | System requires hepatitis_b_screening_result completion through getEligibilityCompletion() validation, enables conditional result field, and includes screening results in clinical recommendations |
| 9 | Provider selects acute HIV symptoms requiring assessment | assessmentData.acute_hiv_symptoms = "yes" with symptom array completion | System validates acute_symptoms_list array completion, generates contraindication alerts through generateClinicalRecommendations(), and recommends HIV testing before PrEP initiation |
| 10 | Provider completes all eligibility sections triggering comprehensive validation | getEligibilityCompletion() returns isComplete with all conditional fields validated | System calculates final eligibility status (eligible/contraindicated/conditional), generates comprehensive clinical recommendations, enables prescription tab access, and provides complete clinical decision support |

- Improved informed consent processes with structured client interest assessment and follow-up planning
- Standardized PrEP candidacy determination aligned with WHO guidelines and Zambian clinical protocols
- Strengthened clinical decision support through evidence-based eligibility criteria and safety screening

## Assessment of Enhancement Requirements

### Understanding of Requirements - Building Progressive Disclosure Eligibility Assessment From Scratch

This requirement involves creating a comprehensive PrEP eligibility assessment system with intelligent progressive disclosure that adapts interface complexity based on client responses. The system must systematically evaluate PrEP candidacy while reducing cognitive load through conditional section visibility.

**Core Progressive Disclosure Sections:**
1. **Section A: Risk Reduction Counseling** (Always visible)
   - Has risk reduction counseling been provided? (Yes/No)
   - Counseling topics covered (multiple selection)
   - Client understanding assessment

2. **Section B: Client Interest Assessment** (Always visible)  
   - Is the client interested in PrEP? (Yes/No/Uncertain)
   - Reason for interest/disinterest (if applicable)
   - Additional questions needed (conditional)

3. **Section C: Follow-up Planning** (Visible only if NOT interested)
   - Alternative prevention methods discussed
   - Follow-up appointment scheduled
   - Additional support services referrals

4. **Section D: Acute HIV Assessment** (Visible only if interested)
   - Recent HIV exposure risk (past 72 hours)
   - Symptoms of acute HIV infection
   - Recent HIV testing history

5. **Section E: Medical History** (Visible only if interested)
   - Current medications and interactions
   - Chronic medical conditions
   - Previous adverse drug reactions

6. **Section F: Clinical Safety Assessment** (Always visible)
   - Contraindication screening checklist
   - Baseline laboratory requirements
   - Clinical safety evaluation

**Eligibility Determination Logic:**
- **Pending**: <5 mandatory fields completed
- **Eligible**: All safety criteria met, no contraindications
- **Deferred**: Contraindications identified or incomplete safety assessment
- **Not Indicated**: Client not interested, low risk profile
