## User Story

### 1. Title
Intelligent Modal Alert System with Completion-Based Clinical Decision Support

### 2. User Story
**As a** healthcare provider managing complex clinical assessments during antenatal consultations,  
**I want** intelligent modal alerts that trigger at appropriate completion milestones with relevant clinical guidance and robust state management,  
**So that** I can receive timely decision support without workflow interruption, maintain clinical focus, and provide evidence-based patient care through optimized modal interactions.

### 3. Acceptance Criteria
| # | Given | When | Then |
|---|-------|------|------|
| 1 | Risk assessment has getCompletionStatus().isComplete = true and calculateANCPrepRisk() returns score ≥5 | Assessment calculation triggers modal through useEffect monitoring calculatedRisk state | PrepDynamicAlertModal opens with open={showClinicalDecisionModal} = true, displays risk-specific recommendations from calculatedRisk.recommendations, and maintains proper z-index (10000) with React Portal rendering |
| 2 | Main PrEP modal is open and POC Test modal launches | handleChildModalStateChange('poc', true) executes with modal hierarchy management | isChildModalTransition is set to true, parent modal onOpenChange prevented through hasActiveChildModals check, POC modal opens with proper state management, and childModals.poc = true |
| 3 | User clicks "Would you like to order this test now?" with child modal active | handleOrderPOCTest() triggers POCTestOrderDialog from within eligibility assessment | Parent modal remains open through event isolation, handleChildModalStateChange('poc', true) executes, event propagation controlled with stopPropagation(), and modal stack maintained |
| 4 | Child modal closes while parent modal is open | handleChildModalStateChange('poc', false) is called with proper state cleanup | lastUserInteraction timestamp updated, parent modal state preserved through isChildModalTransition check, childModals.poc = false, and modal hierarchy maintained |
| 5 | Multiple modals are in the modal stack (PrepDynamicAlertModal, PrepEligibilityModal, POCTestOrderDialog) | User interacts with complex modal hierarchy navigation | Modal state management maintains proper z-index ordering (main: 50, dynamic alert: 10000, eligibility: 10000, POC: 10000), prevents unintended closures through comprehensive event isolation, and executes proper state transitions |
| 6 | Provider manually closes clinical decision modal before completion | User clicks close button setting modalManuallyClosed = true | System respects user preference, prevents auto-reopening through modalManuallyClosed flag, maintains modal state consistency, and resets flag on new assessment data changes |
| 7 | Assessment data changes trigger modal state synchronization | calculateANCPrepRisk() returns updated shouldShowModal state | useEffect monitors calculatedRisk changes, executes modal sync logic, prevents duplicate modal opening through triggerModalOnce(), and maintains proper parent-child modal relationships |
| 8 | Component cleanup on unmount or navigation | ANCPrepModal component unmounts or user navigates away | System executes cleanup useEffect, resets all modal states to false, clears calculatedRisk state, prevents memory leaks, and ensures proper component lifecycle management |
| 9 | Child modal attempts to close parent modal through event bubbling | POC test modal or eligibility modal triggers parent close event | handleMainModalOpenChange detects child modal activity through hasActiveChildModals check, prevents parent closure, maintains modal hierarchy integrity, and preserves clinical workflow continuity |
| 10 | Real-time modal content adaptation based on completion status | Assessment progresses from incomplete to complete with risk level changes | Modal content adapts through generateClinicalRecommendations(), displays progressive clinical guidance, updates action buttons appropriately, and maintains context-aware recommendations throughout workflow |

## Assessment of Enhancement Requirements

### Understanding of Requirements - Building Dynamic Alert Modal System From Scratch

This requirement involves creating a sophisticated modal management system for clinical decision support that provides intelligent, completion-based alerts without disrupting healthcare provider workflows. The system must manage complex modal hierarchies while delivering context-aware clinical recommendations.

**Core Modal System Components:**
1. **Completion-Based Triggering Engine**
   - Real-time assessment completion monitoring
   - Threshold-based modal activation (60% completion minimum)
   - Risk-stratified triggering logic (moderate/high risk only)
   - Clinical context evaluation for appropriate timing

2. **Modal State Management Framework**
   - Parent-child modal hierarchy preservation
   - Event isolation and propagation control
   - State consistency across modal transitions
   - User interaction context tracking

3. **Clinical Decision Content Engine**
   - Risk-appropriate clinical recommendations
   - WHO guideline-compliant content generation
   - Evidence-based action options
   - Contextual clinical guidance

**Modal Triggering Logic:**
```typescript
interface ModalTriggerConditions {
  completionThreshold: number; // 60% minimum
  riskLevelRequired: 'moderate' | 'high'; // No modals for low risk
  mandatoryFieldsCheck: boolean; // All mandatory fields completed
  clinicalSignificance: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'; // Clinical urgency
  userInteractionContext: 'active' | 'idle' | 'transitioning';
}

interface ModalTriggerResult {
  shouldTrigger: boolean;
  modalType: 'clinical_decision' | 'eligibility_recommendations' | 'safety_alert';
  content: ModalContent;
  urgency: 'standard' | 'elevated' | 'urgent';
  actionOptions: ModalAction[];
}
```

### Key Considerations for Implementation

**Modal Hierarchy Management:**
```typescript
interface ModalHierarchyState {
  mainModal: {
    isOpen: boolean;
    type: 'prep_assessment' | 'anc_consultation';
    preserveState: boolean;
  };
  childModals: {
    clinicalDecision: { isOpen: boolean; parentContext: string };
    eligibilityRecommendations: { isOpen: boolean; parentContext: string };
    pocTestOrdering: { isOpen: boolean; parentContext: string };
    prepDeferral: { isOpen: boolean; parentContext: string };
  };
  modalStack: ModalStackItem[];
  eventIsolation: {
    preventParentClose: boolean;
    isolateChildEvents: boolean;
    preserveInteractionContext: boolean;
  };
}
```

**CDSS Content Generation:**
- **Moderate Risk (5-9 points)**: Enhanced counseling recommendations, PrEP consideration guidance
- **High Risk (≥10 points)**: Immediate PrEP initiation discussion, urgent clinical protocols
- **Contraindications Detected**: Safety alerts with alternative management options
- **Eligibility Deferral**: Comprehensive exclusion criteria with follow-up planning

**Event Isolation Architecture:**
```typescript
const handleChildModalEvents = (event: ModalEvent, modalType: string) => {
  // Prevent event propagation to parent modals
  event.stopPropagation();
  event.preventDefault();
  
  // Update modal hierarchy state
  updateModalHierarchy(modalType, event.type);
  
  // Preserve user interaction context
  trackUserInteraction(event.timestamp, event.target);
  
  // Maintain clinical workflow continuity
  preserveAssessmentContext(event.modalData);
};
```

### Best Practice User Experience for Modal Implementation

**Non-Intrusive Modal Timing:**
- Completion thresholds prevent premature interruption
- Clinical significance weighting ensures appropriate urgency
- User interaction context awareness (active vs. idle states)
- Intelligent deferral for incomplete assessments

**Context-Aware Content Delivery:**
- Modal content adapts to assessment completion level
- Risk-stratified recommendations with clinical rationale
- Progressive guidance based on available assessment data
- Clear action pathways for clinical decision-making

**State Preservation Patterns:**
- Assessment data maintained across modal interactions
- User progress preserved during modal transitions
- Clinical context consistency throughout workflow
- Seamless recovery from modal interruptions

### Technical Implementation Architecture

**Modal State Hook:**
```typescript
const useDynamicModalManagement = (
  assessmentData: AssessmentData,
  completionStatus: CompletionStatus
) => {
  const [modalState, setModalState] = useState<ModalHierarchyState>();
  const [triggerConditions, setTriggerConditions] = useState<ModalTriggerConditions>();
  const [isChildModalTransition, setIsChildModalTransition] = useState(false);
  const [lastUserInteraction, setLastUserInteraction] = useState<Timestamp>();
  
  // Completion-based triggering logic
  const evaluateModalTriggers = useCallback((
    completion: CompletionStatus,
    riskData: RiskData,
    clinicalContext: ClinicalContext
  ): ModalTriggerResult => {
    // Threshold evaluation
    const thresholdMet = completion.percentage >= 60;
    const riskRequiresMental = riskData.level !== 'low';
    const clinicalSignificance = evaluateClinicalSignificance(completion, riskData);
    
    if (thresholdMet && riskRequiresMental && clinicalSignificance >= 'medium') {
      return {
        shouldTrigger: true,
        modalType: determineModalType(riskData, completion),
        content: generateModalContent(riskData, completion, clinicalContext),
        urgency: mapRiskToUrgency(riskData.level),
        actionOptions: generateActionOptions(riskData, completion)
      };
    }
    
    return { shouldTrigger: false };
  }, []);
  
  // Child modal state management
  const handleChildModalStateChange = useCallback((
    modalType: string,
    isOpening: boolean,
    userTriggered: boolean
  ) => {
    if (userTriggered) {
      setIsChildModalTransition(true);
      setLastUserInteraction(Date.now());
    }
    
    setModalState(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      childModals: {
        ...prev.childModals,
        [modalType]: { isOpen: isOpening, parentContext: prev.mainModal.type }
      },
      eventIsolation: {
        preventParentClose: isOpening,
        isolateChildEvents: isOpening,
        preserveInteractionContext: true
      }
    }));
  }, []);
  
  return {
    modalState,
    triggerConditions,
    evaluateModalTriggers,
    handleChildModalStateChange,
    isChildModalTransition,
    lastUserInteraction
  };
};
```

**Clinical Decision Modal Component:**
```typescript
const DynamicClinicalDecisionModal = ({
  isOpen,
  onClose,
  riskData,
  assessmentData,
  onActionSelected
}: DynamicModalProps) => {
  const modalContent = useMemo(() => 
    generateClinicalContent(riskData, assessmentData), [riskData, assessmentData]
  );
  
  const handleModalClose = useCallback((event: CloseEvent) => {
    // Ensure user-initiated close (not programmatic)
    if (event.isUserTriggered) {
      // Preserve assessment context
      preserveAssessmentState(assessmentData);
      
      // Update interaction tracking
      trackModalInteraction('clinical_decision', 'closed', event.timestamp);
      
      onClose();
    }
  }, [assessmentData, onClose]);
  
  return (
